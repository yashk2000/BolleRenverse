**1) [SimpleRNN](https://github.com/yashk2000/BolleRenverse/blob/master/SimpleRNN.ipynb)**

This is a simple RNN, a recurrent neural network whch does time series prediction. Given some set of input data, it is able to generate a prediction for the next time step.

**2) [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/yashk2000/BolleRenverse/blob/master/SentimentAnalysis.ipynb)**

This RNN is used to detect the sentiment in a given moview reivew. Given a movie review as an input, it classifes the review as *positive* or *negative*. It used LSTM, Long Short Term Memory to perform the analysis. 

**3) [MNIST GAN](https://github.com/yashk2000/BolleRenverse/blob/master/MNISTGan.ipynb)**

This is a GAN, Generative Adverserial Network used to generate hand written digits. It consists of a a discriminator neural network trained on the MNIST Handwritten digits dataset and a generator neural network which generates new images. If the image is classified as a hand written digit by the discirminator, then we have a digit successfully generated by the GAN. 

**4) [Character Generating RNN](https://github.com/yashk2000/BolleRenverse/blob/master/characterGeneratingRNN/charRNN.ipynb)**

This is a RNN which generates sentences character by character after being trained on a input text which in this case is *Percy Jackson and the Last Olympian*. It requires an input prime, which can be a single string or a collection of strings and generates sentences using those word/s.
