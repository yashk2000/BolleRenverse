**1) [SimpleRNN](https://github.com/yashk2000/BolleRenverse/blob/master/SimpleRNN.ipynb)**

This is a simple RNN, a recurrent neural network whch does time series prediction. Given some set of input data, it is able to generate a prediction for the next time step.

**2) [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/yashk2000/BolleRenverse/blob/master/SentimentAnalysis.ipynb)**

This RNN is used to detect the sentiment in a given moview reivew. Given a movie review as an input, it classifes the review as *positive* or *negative*. It used LSTM, Long Short Term Memory to perform the analysis.
